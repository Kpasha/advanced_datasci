Having recently eliminated film in ultrasound, computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), a simple method was required to access imaging from computers already existing throughout the hospital. The success of the World Wide Web (WWW), the familiarity of endusers with web browsers, and the relative ease of developing user interfaces virtually dictated that such an approach be pursued in our case. The resulting web-based tools allow validated users to search our Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM)-compliant archive servers for specific exams; to download image data from a remote site; to request the retrieval of data from long-term storage; to view images, and to perform certain DICOM routing operations. The existing infrastructure of the internet has allowed us to develop a low-cost system capable of being used for teleradiology. Since low-level, machine-specific interface programming was avoided, these tools were developed rapidly and are easily adapted. The familiarity of browser-based interfaces has facilitated user acceptance, and the benefit of platform independence minimizes software portability concerns.},

Adopting a large-scale perspective is a way to manage the problems endemic to the world of the small-constellations of incompatible tools for which the effort required to assemble an integrated system exceeds the perceived benefit of the integration. Where bioinformatics in-the-small is about data and tools, bioinformatics in-the-large is about metadata and dependencies. Dependencies represent the complexities of large-scale integration, including the requirements and assumptions governing the composition of tools. The popular make utility is a very effective system for defining and maintaining simple dependencies, and it offers a number of insights about the essence of bioinformatics in-the-large. Keeping an in-the-large perspective has been very useful to us in large bioinformatics projects. We give two fairly different examples, and extract lessons from them showing how it has helped. These examples both suggest the benefit of explicitly defining and managing knowledge flows and knowledge maps (which represent metadata regarding types, flows, and dependencies), and also suggest approaches for developing bioinformatics database systems. Generally, we argue that large-scale engineering principles can be successfully adapted from disciplines such as software engineering and data management, and that having an in-the-large perspective will be a key advantage in the next phase of bioinformatics development.},

	abstract = {We present a penalized matrix decomposition (PMD), a new framework for computing a rank-K approximation for a matrix. We approximate the matrix X as , where dk, uk, and vk minimize the squared Frobenius norm of X, subject to penalties on uk and vk. This results in a regularized version of the singular value decomposition. Of particular interest is the use of L1-penalties on uk and vk, which yields a decomposition of X using sparse vectors. We show that when the PMD is applied using an L1-penalty on vk but not on uk, a method for sparse principal components results. In fact, this yields an efficient algorithm for the “SCoTLASS” proposal (Jolliffe and others 2003) for obtaining sparse principal components. This method is demonstrated on a publicly available gene expression data set. We also establish connections between the SCoTLASS method for sparse principal component analysis and the method of Zou and others (2006). In addition, we show that when the PMD is applied to a cross-products matrix, it results in a method for penalized canonical correlation analysis (CCA). We apply this penalized CCA method to simulated data and to a genomic data set consisting of gene expression and DNA copy number measurements on the same set of samples.},

The Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) will have an effective aperture of 6.7 meters and an imaging camera with field of view of 9.6 deg{\textbackslash}ˆ2, and will be devoted to a ten-year imaging survey over 20,000 deg{\textbackslash}ˆ2 south of +15 deg. Each pointing will be imaged 2000 times with fifteen second exposures in six broad bands from 0.35 to 1.1 microns, to a total point-source depth of r{\textbackslash}textasciitilde27.5. The LSST Science Book describes the basic parameters of the LSST hardware, software, and observing plans. The book discusses educational and outreach opportunities, then goes on to describe a broad range of science that LSST will revolutionize: mapping the inner and outer Solar System, stellar populations in the Milky Way and nearby galaxies, the structure of the Milky Way disk and halo and other objects in the Local Volume, transient and variable objects both at low and high redshift, and the properties of normal and active galaxies at low and high redshift. It then turns to far-field cosmological topics, exploring properties of supernovae to z{\textbackslash}textasciitilde1, strong and weak lensing, the large-scale distribution of galaxies and baryon oscillations, and how these different probes may be combined to constrain cosmological models and the physics of dark energy.},

	abstract = {Neuroimaging studies of cognitive control have identified two distinct networks with dissociable resting state connectivity patterns. This study, in patients with heterogeneous damage to these networks, demonstrates network independence through a double dissociation of lesion location on two different measures of network integrity: functional correlations among network nodes and within-node graph theory network properties. The degree of network damage correlates with a decrease in functional connectivity within that network while sparing the nonlesioned network. Graph theory properties of intact nodes within the damaged network show evidence of dysfunction compared with the undamaged network. The effect of anatomical damage thus extends beyond the lesioned area, but remains within the bounds of the existing network connections. Together this evidence suggests that networks defined by their role in cognitive control processes exhibit independence in resting data.},

	abstract = {Variable x-ray and gamma-ray emission is characteristic of the most extreme physical processes in the universe. We present multiwavelength observations of a unique gamma-ray selected transient, detected by the Swift satellite and accompanied by bright emission across the electromagnetic spectrum, and whose properties are unlike any previously observed source. We pinpoint the event to the center of a small, star-forming galaxy at redshift z = 0.3534. Its high-energy emission has lasted much longer than any gamma-ray burst, while its peak luminosity was approximately 100 times higher than bright active galactic nuclei. The association of the outburst with the center of its host galaxy suggests that this phenomenon has its origin in a rare mechanism involving the massive black hole in the nucleus of that galaxy.},

	abstract = {While gas accretion onto some massive black holes (MBHs) at the centers of galaxies actively powers luminous emission, the vast majority of MBHs are considered dormant. Occasionally, a star passing too near a MBH is torn apart by gravitational forces, leading to a bright tidal disruption flare (TDF). While the high-energy transient Sw 1644+57 initially displayed none of the theoretically anticipated (nor previously observed) TDF characteristics, we show that the observations suggest a sudden accretion event onto a central MBH of mass approximately 10(6) to 10(7) solar masses. There is evidence for a mildly relativistic outflow, jet collimation, and a spectrum characterized by synchrotron and inverse Compton processes; this leads to a natural analogy of Sw 1644+57 with a smaller-scale blazar.},
